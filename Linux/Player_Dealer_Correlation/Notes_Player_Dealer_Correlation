To summarize the findings of this investigation 

during the times of 5am, 8am, 2pm,8pm and 11pm on the dates of March the 10th, 12th, and 15th. The player Mylie Schmidt was actively at table playing.

While at the same time the dealer Billy Jones was presiding over the same table. 

All 15 times that this happened both players were directly involved with one another.

Therefore it is the finding of this committee (me) that Billy Jones and Mylie Schmidt are directly responsible for the losses, that the company should take 
appropriate action.
